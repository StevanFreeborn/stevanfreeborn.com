The source code for my small corner of the interwebz.

The site was originally built on squarespace and designed to be used as my personal brands landing page on the web.

Given the simplicity of the site I decided to re-build it myself using plain html, css, javascript, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Credit for the 404 page goes to Jon Kantner's codepen => [https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/aPLWJm](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/aPLWJm).
